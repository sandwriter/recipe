    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Slow cooked Texas-style brisket is extremely tender and juicy. It is one of the most delicious recipe that I
        enjoy. The only caveat is brisket typically comes in 5+ pounds, and that is a lot of food.</p>
    <p><em>Total Time: 8-10 hours</em></p>
    <p><em>Difficulty Level: 2 / 5</em></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Brisket: Costco sells brisket at ~$5/pound at 10+ pound package</li>

        <li>Generous amount of black pepper</li>
